### [](#header-2)Hello! I am Rahul Pandey, Ph.D. _[\[CV\]](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rpandey4/cv_rahulpandey.pdf){:target="_blank"}_.
<!-- Hello, I am **Rahul Pandey**,  -->
I finished my Ph.D. in Information Technology in _Summer 2023_ with a concentration in Information Sciences and Technology. Previously, I finished my undergrad studies in _Computer Science_ from _The LNMIIT_ (Jaipur, India) in _2017_. <!-- It is an amalgam of _Human-AI Collaboration, User Behavior Modeling, Human-Centered Computing, Natural Language Understanding, Applied Machine Learning_ across different modalities including but not limited to _text, images, videos,_ etc.    -->

My research focuses on _human-centered computing_, therefore, particularly on studying how and where to use human inputs in the various components of _AI system design_. It lies at the _intersection_ of _Applied Machine Learning_ and _Natural Language Understanding_ to solve human-centered computing problems across humanitarian and crisis informatics domains.

During my Ph.D., I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Humanitarian Informatics Lab](https://mason.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/informatics-lab.html){:target="_blank"}, [School of Computing](https://computing.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My Ph.D. advisor was [Dr. Hemant Purohit](http://mason.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/){:target="_blank"}.
