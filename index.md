### [](#header-2)Hello! I am Rahul Pandey, _[\[CV\]](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rpandey4/cv_rahulpandey.pdf){:target="_blank"}_.
<!-- Hello, I am **Rahul Pandey**,  -->
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Information Technology with a concentration in Information Sciences and Technology. I have completed my bachelor's in _Computer Science_ from _The LNMIIT_ (Jaipur, India) in _2017_. <!-- It is an amalgam of _Human-AI Collaboration, User Behavior Modeling, Human-Centered Computing, Natural Language Understanding, Applied Machine Learning_ across different modalities including but not limited to _text, images, videos,_ etc.    -->

My research focuses on _human-centered computing_, therefore, particularly on studying how and where to use human inputs in the various components of _AI system design_. It lies at the _intersection_ of _Applied Machine Learning_ and _Natural Language Understanding_ to solve human-centered computing problems across humanitarian and crisis informatics domains.

Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at [Humanitarian, Semantics & Informatics Lab](http://ist.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/informatics-lab.html){:target="_blank"}, [Volgenau School of Engineering](https://volgenau.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My advisor is [Dr. Hemant Purohit](http://ist.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/){:target="_blank"}.
